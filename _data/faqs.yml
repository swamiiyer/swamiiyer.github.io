- title: I need a recommendation letter for a scholarship/job I am applying to. Would you be willing to write one for me?
  body: Sure. I'd be happy to write a recommendation letter for you provided you took one or more classes with me and received an A in all of them. On rare occasions, I'd write the letter even if your grades in my classes fell short of an A provided I have a solid impression of you based on our interactions in and outside the classrooom.


 I'd need at least two weeks to write the letter. In addition, I'll need a short statement from you describing your interests and career goals, and details on where to send the letter and when to send it by.

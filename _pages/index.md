### Biography

I was born in the southern Indian city of Chennai and grew up in Mumbai. I received my primary and secondary education at [Model English School](http://goo.gl/maps/JIxgN) and higher secondary education at [Ruparel College](http://www.ruparel.edu/). During my second year at Ruparel College, I attended the famous (now defunct) [Agrawal Classes](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Coaching-centre-downs-shutters-after-57-years/articleshow/7187553.cms). I received my bachelor's degree in Electronics and Telecommunication from [University of Mumbai](https://mu.ac.in) in 1996 after which I worked for two years as a software engineer at [Tata Interactive Systems](http://www.tatainteractive.com/), where I designed and implemented multimedia-rich e-learning software. I received my master's degree in Computer Science from the [University of Massachusetts at Boston (UMB)](http://www.umb.edu) in 2001, following which I worked at [BMC Software](http://www.bmcsoftware.com/) as a product developer until 2006. My role at BMC Software was to design and develop system- and application-level performance-monitoring software. I then decided to seek a doctoral degree in order to fulfill my ambition of pursuing a career in academia with both research and teaching responsibilities. I received my PhD in Comptuer Science, also from UMB, in 2013. My thesis, entitled [Evolutionary Dynamics on Complex Networks](http://scholarworks.umb.edu/doctoral_dissertations/113), was directed by Prof. Timothy Killingback from the Mathematics Department.

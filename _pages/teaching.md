Throughout my student life I had the good fortune of being taught by some exceptional teachers. I not only learned a lot from them, but also developed a keen interest in sharing my knowledge — however little that may be — with others the way in which my instructors did. The great physicist [Richard Feynman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) once remarked, ‘‘I find that teaching and the students keep life going, and I would never accept any position in which somebody has invented a happy situation for me where I don't have to teach. Never.’’ I feel exactly the same way about teaching.

### Resources

#### Introduction to Programming in Python

- Programs for teaching an introductory course on programming in Python: as a [PDF](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~siyer/teaching/ipp.pdf) and as a [PyCharm project](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~siyer/teaching/ipp.zip). Most of the programs are from the book [Introduction to Programming in Python: An Interdisciplinary Approach](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Programming-Python-Interdisciplinary-Approach/dp/0134076435/) by Robert Sedgewick, Kevin Wayne, and Robert Dondero. 

- Supporting libraries and data types used throughout the book: the [API](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~siyer/teaching/stdlib-python.pdf) and the code as a [PyCharm project](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~siyer/teaching/stdlib-python.zip).

#### Introduction to Programming in Java

- Programs for teaching an introductory course on programming in Java: as a [PDF](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~siyer/teaching/ipj.pdf) and as an [IntelliJ project](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~siyer/teaching/ipj.zip). Most of the programs are from the book [Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Science-Interdisciplinary-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/0134076427/) by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne. 

- Supporting libraries and data types used throughout the book: the API ([PDF](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~siyer/teaching/stdlib-java.pdf) \| [JavaDoc](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~siyer/teaching/stdlib-javadoc)), the binaries as a [jar file](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~siyer/teaching/stdlib.jar) (compiled using OpenJDK 21), and the code as an [IntelliJ project](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~siyer/teaching/stdlib.zip).

#### Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

- Programs for teaching a course on data structures and algorithms in Java: as a [PDF](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~siyer/teaching/dsaj.pdf) and as an [IntelliJ project](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~siyer/teaching/dsaj.zip). Most of the programs are from the book [Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-4th-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/032157351X/) by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.

- Data structures and algorithms discussed in the book: the API ([PDF](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~siyer/teaching/dsalib-java.pdf) \| [JavaDoc](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~siyer/teaching/dsa-javadoc)) and the binaries as a [jar file](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~siyer/teaching/dsa.jar) (compiled using OpenJDK 21).

#### Introduction to Compiler Construction

- Marvin: a hypothetical register-based machine designed for teaching purposes. ([GitHub](https://github.com/swamiiyer/marvin))

- *j\-\-*: a compiler (written in Java) for a language called *j\-\-* and targeting the stack-based Java Virtual Machine. ([GitHub](https://github.com/swamiiyer/j--))

- *iota*: a compiler (also written in Java) for a language called *iota* and targeting the register-based Marvin machine. ([GitHub](https://github.com/swamiiyer/iota))

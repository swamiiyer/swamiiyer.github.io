### Biography

I was born in the southern Indian city of Chennai and grew up in Mumbai. I received my primary and secondary education at [Model English School](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fzLGFB6aNrbtjgdH7) and higher secondary education at [Ruparel College](http://www.ruparel.edu/). During my second year at Ruparel College, I attended the famous (now defunct) [Agrawal Classes](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Coaching-centre-downs-shutters-after-57-years/articleshow/7187553.cms). I received my bachelor's degree in Electronics and Telecommunication from [VESIT](https://vesit.ves.ac.in/) in 1996 after which I worked for two years as a software engineer at Tata Interactive Systems, where I implemented multimedia-rich e-learning software. I received my master's degree in Computer Science from the [University of Massachusetts at Boston (UMB)](http://www.umb.edu) in 2001, following which I worked for five years as a product developer at BMC Software, where I developed system- and application-level performance-monitoring software. In 2006, I decided to get a doctoral degree with the goal of pursuing a career in academia. I received my PhD in Comptuer Science, also from UMB, in 2013. My thesis, entitled [Evolutionary Dynamics on Complex Networks](http://scholarworks.umb.edu/doctoral_dissertations/113), was directed by Prof. Timothy Killingback from the Mathematics Department. After a one-year postdoc with the Physics department at UMB, I joined the Computer Science department as a Lecturer in Fall 2014 and was promoted to Senior Lecturer I in Fall 2021.

Dear student,

Welcome to the Introduction to Computing (CS110) course I will be teaching this semester!

- Please make sure that you meet the prerequisites for the course: Math 140 credits or placement; or Math 130 with a B or higher in the previous semester; or permission of the instructor. 

- Please read through the [course website](/cs110/) very carefully and acquaint yourself with the course mechanics.

- Please take care of the following action items:
  - Sign up for [iClicker](https://app.reef-education.com/\#/account/create iClicker) (attendance platform) using your UMB email address, and add the course *CS110* to your dashboard
  - Follow up on the invitations that will be sent to your UMB email address to sign up for:
      - Piazza (Q&A platform) and
      - Gradescope (grading platform).
  - Setup the [programming environment](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~siyer/teaching/cs110/ipp_programming_environment_setup.pdf) on your computer.
  - Fill out the questionnaire available on Gradescope.
  - Complete the [Supplemental Instruction (SI) poll](https://forms.gle/3xNfwuYchDVUjVSF7).
  - Sign up for a [CS account](course_info.html#cs_account).

- CS110 is a very demanding course, so please be prepared to work really hard from the outset, or else you will quickly fall behind and end up with a poor/failing grade.

- If you are currently waitlisted, you will be enrolled automatically if enough students drop out before the add/drop deadline. Please note that I will **not** go over the enrollment capacity for the course, which is set at 200.

- <font color="red">NOTE: During the first week we will only meet for lectures. Discussions and SI sessions will start from the second week, ie, the week of Sep 11.</font>

I look forward to having you in my class.

Best,

Swami

**Welcome Message**

Dear student,

Welcome to the Intermediate Computing with Data Structures (CS210) course I will be teaching this semester!

- Please make sure that you meet the prerequisites for the course: CS110 with a grade of C- or better or permission of the instructor.

- Please read through the [course website](/cs210/) very carefully and acquaint yourself with the course mechanics.

- Please take care of the following action items:
  - Review the [math tutorial](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~siyer/teaching/math_tutorial.pdf).
  - Review the [command-line tutorial](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~siyer/teaching/cmdline_tutorial.pdf).
  - Sign up for [iClicker](https://app.reef-education.com/\#/account/create iClicker) (active learning platform) using your UMB email address and add the course *CS210* to your dashboard. You will need to purchase an [iClicker Student App Subscription](https://www.iclicker.com/pricing#student-pricing) to participate in the in-class quizzes.
  - Sign up for Piazza (Q&A platform) and Gradescope (grading platform) using the invitations that will be sent to your UMB email address.
  - Setup the [programming environment](programming_environment.html) on your computer.
  - Complete the mandatory questionnaire (all six questions) available on Gradescope. You will **not** be allowed to submit your assignments or take the exams until you complete the questionnaire. 
  - Complete the [Supplemental Instruction (SI) poll](https://forms.gle/4WCsvN7iQDoSf8DV9).
  - Sign up for a [CS account](course_info.html#cs_account).

- CS210 is a very demanding course, so please be prepared to work really hard from the outset, or else you will quickly fall behind and end up with a poor/failing grade.

- If you are currently waitlisted, you will be enrolled automatically if enough students drop out before the add/drop deadline. Please note that I will **not** go over the enrollment capacity for the course, which is set at 84.

- <font color="red">NOTE: During the first week we will only meet for lectures. Discussions and SI sessions will start from the second week, ie, the week of Sep 9.</font>

I look forward to having you in my class.

Best,

Swami
